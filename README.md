# Moderately Complex Python Assignment (Hangman)
Author: Marie Southworth

Purpose: This program is a simple Hangman game in which the player is given a random word that has been masked out. The player must correctly guess all the letters in the word within a limited number of tries (which they get to pick at the outset) or they lose.

How to use: Run 'python hangman.py' and follow the prompts (begin new game, enter filename/path, guess letter, etc.)
